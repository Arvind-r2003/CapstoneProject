# Calculator

## using the calculator:
* you need to enter the numbers manually by clicking the buttons given on the screen, or by first clicking on the input box and then typing in keyboard. 
* you are only suppose to enter numbers. 
* its very basic code. so exceptions are not handled rigorously. 
* in case any error, just figure it out. if you can, git clone, you should be able to do that.
